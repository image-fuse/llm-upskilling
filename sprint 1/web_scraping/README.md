# Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup

## Introduction

Web scraping is a powerful technique for extracting data from websites, streamlining the process of data collection and reducing manual effort. In this project, we utilize Beautiful Soup for web scraping and save the scraped data in a JSON file.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the required libraries installed using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml
pip install requests
```

## General Usage

### Import Required Libraries and Functions:

```bash
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import json
import os
```

### Sending an HTTP Request:

To initiate web scraping, send an HTTP GET request to the URL of the webpage.

```bash
url = 'https://example.com'
response = requests.get(url)
html_text = response.text
```

### Parsing HTML Content:

Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup, providing methods to navigate and extract data from the HTML document.

```bash
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_text, 'lxml')
```

### Locating Data:

Identify HTML elements, attributes, and hierarchy to locate the specific data for scraping.

```bash
data = soup.find('div', class_='example-class')
```

### Extracting Data:

Use BeautifulSoup methods to extract data, such as text or attribute values.

```bash
text = data.text
attribute_value = data['attribute_name']
```

### Storing Data:

Store the extracted data in an appropriate data structure, like lists or dictionaries, for further processing or saving.

```bash
data_list = []
data_list.append(data)
```

### Handling Pagination (if necessary):

Save the scraped data to a chosen file format, like JSON or CSV, for future analysis or use.

```bash
with open('data.json', 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(data_list, json_file)
```
